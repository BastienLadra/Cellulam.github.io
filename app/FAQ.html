						<p>To better protect your account, we have implemented extensive verification of card payments. This helps us to avoid any use of lost or stolen cards in our system. In rare cases, this verification procedure affects valid cards.

							A card can also be rejected if:
							The issuer encounters technical problems preventing the authorization of a transaction.
							The issuer sees an unusual debit and blocks the transaction to protect you.
							You have involuntarily exceeded your card limit.
							Contact the service or any other person responsible for lifting the following restrictions:
							Limits on amounts per transaction, or monthly or weekly limits that can be applied to your card for online or PayPal transactions.
							Limits for foreign currency transactions online or with PayPal.
							The limits concerning the countries of receipt of your payments for online transactions or with PayPal.
							If you know your card is valid but your payment has failed:
							Contact your card issuer directly. Ask why your card was rejected and if you can still use it. If so, try to renew your transaction.
							Pay securely online with your bank account. You can register your bank account with your PayPal account in just a few minutes. The merchant never sees your personal information or your bank details.</p>
